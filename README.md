# Body Scroll Lock

An **iOS safari compatible** technique to **lock body scroll**.
This is basically the classic `position: fixed;` on **html element** hack on steroids: it saves the scroll position and reserves a gap for [scrollbar width](#the-scrollbar-width-issue).

## The Backstory

The **proper way** to lock body scroll has always been putting `overflow: hidden;` **on body element**, but unfortunately this approach **just doesn't work on iOS safari**. ðŸ™…<br>
The cleanest way to overcome this unfortunate situation would be [preventing `touchmove` events](https://github.com/willmcpo/body-scroll-lock), but you might still have **issues** with some **`viewport` configurations** along with **pinch to zoom** taking place or **iOS navigation bars** covering your elements.<br>
Since **this script** is more of a tool to programmatically **generate some CSS overrides rules** put in head element, I always considered this approach the most convenient solution: no event listeners to add/remove; no scrollable inner-elements to keep in mind, no problems. âœŒ<br>
An halfway solution would be using the css `touch-action` property, but, again, [**safari doesn't** seem to **support it**](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133112) any time soon ðŸ™„, so...

## Usage

The inclusion of **body-scroll.js** sets a global **bodyScroll** variable, which is basically an `Object` with some `methods` in it.

To **lock** the body scroll simply call the `lock` method.

```javascript
window.bodyScroll.lock(); // freeze!
```

To **unlock** it, call the `unlock` one.

```javascript
window.bodyScroll.unlock(); // scroll free, little bird.
```

The main aim during the writing of this code was to be as seamless as possible, so, without the use of any css class, inline style or element attribute, the only built-in way to keep track of the current **lock status** is to call the `isLocked` method.

```javascript
window.bodyScroll.isLocked(); // true when locked...
```

Lazy? Just `toggle` it...

```javascript
window.bodyScroll.toggle(); // locks if unlocked, unlocks if locked!
```

## Events

Get notified when scroll **state changes** listening to `bodyScrollLock` and `bodyScrollUnlock` **events**.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('bodyScrollLock', () =>
    console.log('Body scroll has been locked')
);

window.addEventListener('bodyScrollUnlock', () =>
    console.log('Body scroll has been unlocked')
);
```

## The scrollbar width issue

Browsers which provide a system scrollbar have always experienced that unpleasant "jump" effect when hiding it, this library doesn't do anything obtrusive to solve this problem, but lets you take care of that in the way you like exposing the exact scrollbar size in the above-mentioned events.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('bodyScrollLock', event =>
    console.log('Indent right-aligned elements ' + event.detail.scrollbarWith)
);
```
